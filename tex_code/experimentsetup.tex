\section{Experiment Setup}

	In the following sections we introduce the general experiment setup as well as the various test scenarios and parameters that were used to obtain the final results.
	
	\subsection{Test Architecture}
	Our simulation of the spread spectrum mechanisms is based on a simple pipeline, where a \emph{sender} is writing its data onto a \emph{medium}. Various kinds of interference is generated by a \emph{jammer} which adds its data to the medium. Finally the \emph{receiver} reads data from the medium and tries to decode the original bit sequence.
	
	\paragraph{Sender}
	The sender is responsible for spreading a random data sequence consisting of $0$s and $1$s using either the \emph{DSSS} or \emph{FHSS} spreading mechanism as explained in section \ref{sec:theory}. After spreading, the sender will modulate the spread data onto passband using the BPSK modulation scheme (using a phase-shift of $\Delta \phi = \pi / 2$) with a carrier frequency $f_c$ in the case of DSSS. With FHSS, the sender generates a set of $n=8$ sub-carrier frequency bands of bandwidth $\Delta f$. The modulated signal is then passed to the \emph{medium}
	
	\paragraph{Medium} 
	After a signal is sent to the medium, we perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the data and store the result. A jammer may then add an interference signal onto the original data, depending on the respective test scenario. Whenever a receiver reads data from the medium, we perform an inverse FFT and pass the data to the receiver.
	
	\paragraph{Receiver}
	The receiver first reads the data off the medium and applies the respective demodulation scheme according to the scheme that was used to send the data in the first place. If DSSS was used, the receiver simply demodulates the whole signal using BPSK and despreads the signal using the same pn-sequence that the sender used. In the case of FHSS ...(insert FHSS despreading here).
		
	\paragraph{Jammer}
	We used multiple approaches to designing our jammer. The most reliable method -- the method we used in our results -- was designing the jammer as just another DSSS user whose bandwidth we can control using the chipping rate. One of the most difficult aspects of this simulation was the power control of this jammer with respect to the signal power that is already on the medium. As a result, we always specify the power of the jammer as a power factor $p_f$ relative to the total power of the signal to be jammed.
	
	\subsection{Testing Scenarios and Parameters}
	Throughout all test scenarios, the carrier frequency for all DSSS tests remained $f_c = 100\text{Hz}$. The channel configuration for FHSS is also constant, with the sub-carriers starting at frequency $f_c = 100\text{Hz}$ with a channel bandwidth of $\Delta f = 128 \text{Hz}$. The symbol rate was fixed at $f_{sym} = 8\text{Hz}$. In each test, white Gaussian noise with an SNR of $10\text{dB}$ was added to the time domain signal to simulate interference of various origins.
	
	Each test scenario was conducted with the same variable parameters consisting of the chipping rate $f_{chip}$ and the length of the pn-sequence $l_{pn}$. For both FHSS and DSSS, we used $l_{pn} = (16, 64)$. Initial tests showed that these are sensible values. The chipping rates used in DSSS were $f_{chip}^{DSSS} = (16,32,64,96)$, in FHSS $f_{chip}^{FHSS} = (1, 4, 16, 32)$ respectively. Combined, the two paremeter sets $l_{pn}$ and $f_{chip}$ form eight curves in each plot of a test scenario.
	
	\paragraph{Narrowband Interference}
	In this scenario, we tested the performance of both spreading schemes under the influence of narrowband interference. The parameters used are summarized in table \ref{tab:narrowband}
