\section{Conclusion}
    In this project we did a simulation of the spreading techniques \emph{Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)} and \emph{Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)}.\\
    
    
    The simulation is implemented in object oriented Matlab. It includes support to simulate noise on the medium and jamming of different frequencies. Our goal was to see which of the both schemes is more robust against different kinds of noise.\\

    Further work could include support for simulation of free-space path loss. The distance between the sender and the receiver would then influence the quality of the signal. Additionally one could extend the free-space path loss by using a custom propagation coefficient to simulate more complex environments like buildings and other obstacles that prevent direct line of sight.
    
    
    Another future work could be to not only measure bit-error rates but also introduce a packet-error rate. To support this one would first need to decide how a packet should be defined. One possibility is to combine a fixed amount of bits to a packet, or send a special bit sequence to announce the begin of a new packet.
